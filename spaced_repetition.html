<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Spaced repetition is a powerful learning method, memory aid, habit
reinforcer, and randomness generator that has added a lot of value to my
life. I give a brief introduction to spaced repetition learning, why
I’ve found it useful, and a few of the lessons I’ve picked up along the
way. Then, I link to some of my current shared decks, broken down by
topic, made using the free, open-source software <a
href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Most of the time, it is acceptable to learn something in the short
run and accept that you will probably forget it later. Maybe you don’t
care about the material long-term and just want to pass a course. Or
maybe you need to understand a topic well enough to execute a two-month
long project, and after that you have good reason to expect the
knowledge will lose its value.</p>
<p>But sometimes forgetting information is needlessly inefficient. For
example, if you learn some aspect of statistics in a course and want to
be able to apply it in your research career over the next 10 to 20
years.</p>
<p>The US, where I went to school, has a semester-based system that
incentivizes you to learn topics briefly — at worst for one exam, at
best for one or two semesters — and implicitly expects you to remember
them from then on. This is an excellent way to temporarily store
information for a few days or months, but is not an efficient way to
stabilize long-term memories.</p>
<p>Let’s step back and look at some of the science of memory. When it
comes to memory, there are two effects we want to take advantage of.</p>
<p>The first is the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">spacing effect</a>,
which is the finding that humans learn things better when they recall
them in spaced intervals over a series of hours, days, weeks, or months,
rather than the same number of times massed all at once. Taken to its
logical extreme, the effect suggests that there is an optimal point at
which it is best to recall something, which is when you are about to
forget it.</p>
<p>These <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve">forgetting
curves</a> were mapped by Hermann Ebbinghaus in a manuscript published
in 1885. If you want to learn something long-term and are able to use
spaced repetition to do so, harnessing the spacing effect is close to a
free lunch.</p>
<p>The second effect is the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect">testing effect</a>,
which is the finding that humans learn better when they actively recall
or use a fact/definition/idea instead of passively reading or hearing
it. This is less of a free lunch, though, because actively recalling
something does seem to take more mental energy than just reading it or
hearing it. But it’s still quite powerful if you can muster the
willpower.</p>
<p>Computer-based spaced repetition (SR) flashcard software allows you
to harness both of these effects in a convenient way. The algorithms are
automatically set to query and refresh your memory of a topic when they
estimate that you are likely to forget it. Based on Ebbinghaus’s
forgetting curves, study interval periods expand with repetitions. So,
for example, after first learning a flashcard, you will be re-tested on
it in (approximately) 1 day, then 4 days, then 12 days, then 1 month,
then 3 months, then 9 months, etc.</p>
<p>By taking advantage of the spacing effects and testing effects,
spaced repetition will allow you to learn in ways that are more likely
to stick.</p>
</div>
<div id="spaced-repetition-for-learning-facts" class="section level2">
<h2>Spaced repetition for learning facts</h2>
<p>Most people use spaced repetition flashcards for learning facts —
definitions, dates, names, relationships, nuances.</p>
<p>In general, the simpler and more precise the fact, the easier it is
learn the memory. This is in part because the cue-recall process is
faster, and in part because it is easier to evaluate whether you got a
flashcard right if the fact is simpler/smaller/shorter/more precise.
Simpler facts also can make it more fun to review your flashcard sets,
since they tend to be less mentally taxing. But longer facts can
sometimes be more helpful when you want to apply your knowledge, as you
can bring to mind all the relevant info in one “chunk.” It’s best to
figure out what works for you in different situations.</p>
<p>As of the 2010s, when I was most into the spaced repetition
community, the main two applications for spaced repetition were language
learning and medical school.</p>
<p>Language learning is kind of obvious — translation between languages
lends itself very well to short, one-word facts, and there are clearly
definable goals.</p>
<div id="spaced-repetition-for-medicine" class="section level3">
<h3>Spaced repetition for medicine</h3>
<p>Med school has just the right confluence of factors to lend itself to
spaced repetition learning: huge career incentives to do well on
memorization-based exams, positive social feedback because for better or
worse medicine has a culture of memorization, plausible future benefits
to patients in knowing more facts, and an endless volcano of
relationships between diseases, symptoms, treatments, and side effects
that can absorb as much time as you want to pour into it. If you’re
interested to see how this works, one of the major communities for it
has been <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki">r/medicalschoolanki</a>.</p>
<p>An aside on using Anki for med school since I poured a lot of time
into this myself: One of the most difficult but necessary things to
learn is lists. Lists are everywhere in medicine, coming up as symptoms,
treatments, side effects, etc.</p>
<p>What has worked for me to memorize lists is to make separate
flashcards: one as an overall mnemonic for the list, and then separate
flashcards for up to three of the members of the list at a time. A good
mnemonic is short — this will make it harder to learn, but when you
actually need to recall the mnemonic when you are talking to a patient,
on a multiple choice test, or on rounds, you will be time-limited and
need to the recall the mnemonic quickly. This is mostly for making your
own cards, which I did a lot of, but now I would recommend using one of
the high quality, pre-made decks.</p>
</div>
<div id="spaced-repetition-for-science-research" class="section level3">
<h3>Spaced repetition for science research</h3>
<p>When I was doing full-time science research during my PhD, I was
mostly using spaced repetition flashcards for learning two types of
things:</p>
<p>1: Learning programming languages, both the syntax and the
vocabulary.</p>
<p>Syntax was most helpful when I was remembering the names of functions
that I use a moderate amount — enough to justify time spent on the
flashcard, but not enough that I would remember it even without a
flashcard.</p>
<p>Vocabulary related to programming concepts has probably been more
helpful, because it helps me figure out the Google search terms I should
use in order to solve a problem, which is the most important thing for
the type of programming I do. Examples here include terms related to
recursion, matrices, parallelization, and functional programming.</p>
<p>2: Learning about my research topics, e.g., Alzheimer’s and genomics.
The jury is still out on whether this is a good use of time, but in
general, I would say to not sleep on it if you’re a researcher. For
example, at the cutting edge of any research field, understanding the
history of why opinions have formed, and where the evidence is weak vs
strong, is essential. Instead of exclusively reading new material,
there’s often more value to be gained from memorizing and systematically
reflecting upon key points from material you’ve already read, especially
if you have a highly imperfect memory like me.</p>
</div>
<div id="spaced-repetition-for-personal-trivia" class="section level3">
<h3>Spaced repetition for personal trivia</h3>
<p>I’ve also used spaced repetition for learning facts related to my
personal life — people’s names, where they went to school, what is
important to them, anniversaries, etc. The possibilities are endless. If
you’re bad at remembering names, adopting a habit to make a flashcard
with someone’s name after you meet them and then to review it is an easy
way to get good at it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="spaced-repetition-for-forming-habits" class="section level2">
<h2>Spaced repetition for forming habits</h2>
<p>Spaced repetition learning acknowledges that memory recall success
decays over time and that recalling a fact can refresh its memory.</p>
<p>My hypothesis here is that you can do spaced repetition habit
formation by acknowledging that unpracticed habit automaticity decays
over time and that reminding yourself of a habit can help you to build
automaticity around it.</p>
<p>First, what is habit automaticity? This is the idea that deeply
ingrained habits occur effortlessly, without the need for conscious
decision-making. Automatic is the state that people want the habits they
consider healthy to be in, and their unhealthy habits out of. It’s like
flossing once a day, not necessarily because you want to, but just
because that’s what you do.</p>
<p>Habit automaticity takes a long time to build. One study found that,
depending on the complexity of the habit, it took anywhere from 18 to
254 days to get a habit to 95% automaticity, with a median of 66 days <a
href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674"><span
class="citation">(Lally et al., 2010)</span></a>. And this was for daily
habits like ‘drinking a bottle of water with lunch’; if you’re trying to
build a moderately complex habit that you do less frequently, it might
take even longer.</p>
<p>The idea behind spaced repetition habit formation is that you create
a flashcard with the same expanding time schedule as a normal flashcard.
However, when you see this type flashcard, your job isn’t to remember a
fact, but to think to yourself about how automatic the habit on the
flashcard is.</p>
<p>If the habit isn’t automatic at all, then you click “Wrong” and you
will see the habit again tomorrow.</p>
<p>If the habit is super automatic, then you can click “Good” and you
won’t see the habit flashcard again for quite a few days.</p>
<p>The habit doesn’t even need to be an action that you perform
externally — it can be a purely mental habit that you’re trying to form
or break.</p>
<p>From my perspective, there are three major benefits to this spaced
repetition habit formation strategy:</p>
<p>You will be reminded of the habits that you are trying to form, in
case you have simply forgotten about them. This is especially good for
habits that you may have formed months or years ago but forgotten about
over time. Maybe you won’t want to keep doing them — that’s a good
realization and you can just delete or suspend the flashcard.</p>
<p>By having a structured time to think about whether you are performing
the habit or not, you have an opportunity to give yourself some
reinforcement or credit for a job well done. You can tell which habits
you are struggling with and may need to devote more energy to by looking
at the statistics of the habit cards over time.</p>
<p>Habit flashcards will likely be deeply personal. The ones that work
for me probably wouldn’t be as helpful for you, and vice versa. That
said, in the spirit of being concrete, here are a few of the habit
flashcards that I have the most reviews for over the past few years:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>I have about 200 active habit flashcards at a time, and do about
10-20 reviews a day. These are my favorite reviews to do because they
don’t require as much cognitive load as recall, and I will do them even
when I don’t have the energy to do memory recall flashcards.</p>
<p>Remember that there is no “right answer” to these. Rather, they are
an opportunity for you to introspect about how well you are achieving
the habit and whether you want to devote more resources to it, refine
the habit, or abandon it.</p>
<p>If you try out or are interested in trying out habit flashcards, I
would love to hear whether you find them helpful and/or ways that the
system could be improved.</p>

<h2>Spaced repetition for re-reading quotes or re-viewing images</h2>
<p>In addition to memory recall flashcards and habit flashcards, I also
have a separate deck where I copy in quotes or images that I enjoy —
famous ones, quotes from articles I like, quotes from my friends and
family, beautiful photos of nature, famous artwork, particularly funny
memes, random thoughts I have, etc. Because I do not turn the
information into a question about a particular fact, I am giving up the
testing effect, and I don’t tend to retain the knowledge very well. But
they are low-effort to make, it is nice to review them when I have low
energy, and I don’t care as much about free recalling the information as
I do about periodically reminding myself of them. I view this as a way
to add randomness to my life by having a conversation with myself over a
longer period of time.</p>

class="section level2">
<h2>My overall spaced repetition experience</h2>
<p>Although I’ve been doing spaced repetition via Anki since February
2011, I wanted to start doing SR flashcards for several years before I
actually started — approximately speaking, since May 2008, when I read
<a href="http://www.wired.com/2008/04/ff-wozniak/?currentPage=all">this
Wired article about Piotr Wozniak</a>. Wozniak truly devoted himself to
spaced repetition. He seemed like an interesting person, his technique
seemed like a good use of my time, and I wanted to do it.</p>
<p>For the next 3 years after that I had a fairly constant low level of
guilt/anxiety about how I should be doing SR flashcards. This anxiety
spiked whenever I forgot something I had previously learned. Of course,
after a year or so, I thought it was too late and that I was a lost
cause with respect to spaced repetition.</p>
<p>(Coincidentally, I now have a habit flashcard for how to counteract
this exact flaw in my psychology. I call it “future weaponry” — when you
see something cool that others are using, instead of thinking about what
you could have done with a particular tool/knowledge/ability in the
past, choose to think about what you will be able to do with it in the
future.)</p>
<p>Spaced repetition flashcards weren’t really feasible, though, until I
got a smartphone. Say what you want about smartphones with respect to
productivity overall, but the ability to do spaced repetition flashcards
on them while walking and waiting around is for me, their killer app.
And this basically requires easy syncing via an internet connection.</p>
<p>Looking back at my cards from when I started, they’re pretty
terrible. For example, I used tons of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test">cloze deletion</a>
cards, a lazy and less effective way of making flashcards, rather than
thinking about what knowledge I really wanted to retain and framing it
in question form. I was also obsessed with memorizing math equations
even though these have been pretty much completely useless.</p>
<p>That said, by far the most important thing for me back then was to
enjoy myself and maintain motivation, and I’ve been able to do that so
far. I recommend you also try not to sweat the details as you begin your
journey in spaced repetition.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>I owe a lot to Damien Elmes, who wrote the open-source, free Anki
software. I also owe a lot to Gwern, <a
href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">who has written about
spaced repetition extensively</a>, and who made thousands of his
Mnemosyne cards available to anyone to download for free. I downloaded
these one day on a whim, converted them to Anki, and that was what
really made me think of having my own cards as being a realistic,
practical option. Thanks, Damien and Gwern.</p>
