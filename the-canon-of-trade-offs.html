<div id="introduction" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Most of the time, when we make decisions, we don’t bother thinking
about the trade-offs involved. Instead, we focus on the details of the
particular decision we have to make. Meta-level reasoning is
time-consuming and taxing, so most of the time, this is the best
strategy. Then why think at all about decisions at the more abstract,
trade-off level? I offer a few reasons:</p>
<p>First, it can lend clarity to the types of parameters that we might
want to consider when we do reason explicitly. In multi-dimensional
problems in particular, it can be useful to have a vocabulary to
consider and discuss the most important decision axes.</p>
<p>Second, we can learn useful heuristics that we can apply without much
explicit reasoning the next time we make a decision that involves that
class of trade-off.</p>
<p>Third, it offers a way to organize examples so that we can more
efficiently learn about how others have dealt with the types of
decisions that we face.</p>
<p>Fourth, I think there is a psychological benefit of some kind in
knowing that you are not alone in facing some of these dilemmas.</p>
<p>Finally, I think a broader awareness and an accepted common knowledge
that <em>there are trade-offs</em> will help make policy discussions
more fruitful at the local and broader scales.</p>
<p>I’m always on the look-out to add a) canon-worthy classes of
trade-offs that are currently not subsumed by the below or b) any nice
examples of examples of trade-offs within a class. If you have any
thoughts, please <a href="https://andrewtmckenzie.com/">contact

<div id="efficiency-vs-unpredictability" class="section level3">
<h3>#1: Efficiency vs Unpredictability</h3>
<p>“It’s funny. All you have to do is say something nobody understands
and they’ll do practically anything you want them to.” – J.D.
Salinger</p>
<p>Upside of efficiency: achieve your goals using fewer resources</p>
<p>Upside of unpredictability: competitors are worse at modeling your
behavior</p>
<p><b>Major Example</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_&#39;em">Texas
Hold ’Em</a>, if you’d never make a large bet pre-flop with a bad hand
like J3 off-suit, then your opponents can be be very sure that you do
not have that hand if you make that bet. So, making an aggressive bet
even with a bad hand every now and then makes it harder for your
opponents to model you. This makes it easier for you to deceive them. On
the other hand, there are fewer ways for a relatively worse hand to win
if the betting does come to a showdown.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ancillary Examples</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipredator_adaptation">ethology</a>,
consider a prey animal escaping from its predator. If the prey
predictably uses the same, efficient trick to escape, it saves energy
that would be spent escaping. But, its predator can learn this rule and
use it for capture. For example, see a tentacled snake learn such a rule
<a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urBp2X5mBmQ&amp;feature=player_embedded">here</a>.</li>
<li>In primate status and courtship games, individuals likely benefited
from veiling their true intentions in conversation <a
href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1997-36638-011"><span
class="citation">(Miller, 1997)</span></a>. In such a situation,
deception-detection becomes advantageous as well, and one way for agents
to fool others and make their mental modeling more difficult is to be
unpredictable. This likely selected for some amount of randomness and
thus novelty in behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p class="caption"><a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urBp2X5mBmQ&amp;feature=player_embedded">The
tentacled snake’s knowledge of its prey’s escape rule</a></p>
</div>
</center>
<p><b>Properties</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In a competitive environment, the classic way for an agent to
sacrifice efficiency for unpredictability is through adding randomness
to its behavior. The key question is typically not <em>whether</em> to
add randomness, but <em>how much</em> randomness to add.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="speed-vs-accuracy" class="section level3">
<h3>#2: Speed vs Accuracy</h3>
<p>“Fast is fine but accuracy is final.” – Wyatt Earp</p>
<p>Upside to speed: less time to achieve goal</p>
<p>Upside to accuracy: higher probability of success in achieving
goal</p>
<p><b>Major Example</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Like many machine learning algorithms, Watson, the AI created by IBM
to compete at Jeopardy, faced a speed vs accuracy trade-off in that the
longer it has to search its databases and run its algorithms, the more
confidently it could assign a high probability to one of its
answers.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ancillary Examples</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In football, field goal (FG) kickers must contract their muscles
quicker in order to swing their thighs more rapidly when they want to
kick the ball further. This comes at the cost of decreased average
coordination among muscle movements, because each of them must occur
within a narrower window. Thus, we see a decrease in lateral accuracy of
field goals as longitudinal distance increases.</li>
<li>In communication, if you take longer to respond to emails, people
will expect your responses to be more accurate, whereas if respond right
away, their expectations will be much lower. This is because your
interlocutors will intuitively recognize the trade-off you face between
speed and accuracy.</li>
</ul>

href="http://www.advancednflstats.com/2008/11/just-for-kicks.html">2008
NFL Field Goal Data</a></p>
</div>
</center>
<p><b>Properties</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Speed vs accuracy trade-offs tend to operate within particular
ranges. Outside of these ranges, probabilities of success/failure
theoretically should increase/decrease to 1/0. However, among humans, it
is fairly common that the probability of success can paradoxically
revert more towards the mean outside of this range, as people
(especially non-domain experts) “overthink” their decision or
action.</li>
</ul>

<div id="exploration-vs-exploitation" class="section level3">
<h3>#3: Exploration vs Exploitation</h3>
<p>“Don’t get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it
grow; be like water.” - Bruce Lee</p>
<p>“I think that the minute that you have a backup plan, you’ve admitted
that you’re not going to succeed.” - Elizabeth Holmes</p>
<p>Upside to exploration: learn more about possible choices</p>
<p>Upside to exploitation: gain on average more from the outcome of this
particular choice</p>
<p><strong>Major Example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In developmental economics, you can think of basic science research
as “exploration” and of applied science research as “exploitation” <a
href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/respol/v30y2001i3p509-532.html"><span
class="citation">(Salter et al., 2001)</span></a>. That is, investing in
the search for mechanism with a relatively less clear pathway towards
usefulness takes scarce resources, but probabilistically makes future
applied efforts more powerful.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ancillary Examples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">the
multi-armed bandit problem</a>, a gambler is faced with multiple levers
to pull from, each of which has an unknown but unique distribution of
payouts. She can either sample a diverse set of levers to discover more
info about their expected reward, or she can just choose the lever with
the highest current expected payout.</li>
<li>In organization theory, firms can “exploit” their worker’s knowledge
by forcing them to socialize to their particular cultural code more
quickly, but this leads to less “exploration” and ultimately a lower
equilibrium knowledge level for the firm <a
href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2634940"><span
class="citation">(March, 1991)</span></a>.</li>
</ul>

Learning”</a></p>
</div>
</center>
<p><strong>General Properties</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As one’s initial knowledge about a topic becomes relatively worse,
exploration becomes relatively more valuable relative to
exploitation.</li>
<li>Another way of formulating this trade-off is through the lens of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing">satisficing vs
optimizing</a>.</li>

<h3>#4: Precision vs Simplicity</h3>
<p>“Plurality is never to be posited without necessity.” - <a
href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_of_Occam">William of
Occam</a></p>
<p>Upside to precision: explain a more specific set of phenomena
better</p>
<p>Upside to simplicity: explain a more general set of phenomena
better</p>
<p><strong>Major Example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine that you have three best friends. Two of them are kind
<em>green aliens</em> and one of them is rich. You could say “I am the
kind of person who could only be friends with someone who is either kind
and a green alien, or rich.” But this might be overfitting your model of
friendship to your current sample. Instead, it might be more appropriate
to say that you could only be friends with someone who is either kind or
rich.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ancillary Examples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In describing the path up to one’s apartment, one could say “there
are 114 stairs”, or one could say “there are on the order of 100
stairs”; vagueness is less precise but it is also simpler and easier to
communicate.</li>
<li>In a <a
href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/lectures/ch04.pdf">statistical
regression</a>, consider building a model while varying the smoothing
parameter that specifies the degree to which nearby training data points
are averaged together when formulating the prediction. If you do
relatively more smoothing, then your prediction will be relatively less
precise in explaining the training set, but it is also simpler because
it is less affected by potential outliers, so it might explain new data
better.</li>
</ul>

<p class="caption"><a
href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/">The generalization
error of a regression model (black) is based on intrinsic data noise
(green), approximation error from smoothing (i.e., lack of simplicity,
red), and estimator variance (i.e. lack of precision, blue). Modified

</div>
</center>
<p><strong>General Properties</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The propensity of humans to incorrectly trade-off precision and
simplicity in certain contexts, like when we say that the probability of
events X <em>and</em> Y is greater than the probability of just event X,
is called the <a

fallacy</a>. </li>

<h3>#5: Surely Some vs Maybe More</h3>
<p>“A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” - <a
href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/a-bird-in-the-hand.html">Medieval proverb</a></p>
<p>Upside of surely some: higher probability of achieving goal state</p>
<p>Upside of maybe more: goal state has higher utility</p>
<p><strong>Major Example</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinkmanship">game
theory</a>, brinkmanship is the practice of pushing competitive
negotiation situations to the verge of disaster, in an attempt to induce
concessions from one’s opponent. The closer towards disaster
the situation is pushed, the riskier brinkmanship becomes, since
the situation is more likely to truly reach disaster. On the other hand,
closer to the edge often means that the expected value of concessions
from one’s opponent improves, too. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ancillary Examples</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>In evolutionary psychology, the decision between someone who is more
stable and dependable or someone with better looks and health is one of
the universal trade-offs across cultures <a
href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2005-07297-020"><span
class="citation">(Shackelford et al., 2005)</span></a>.</li>
<li>In finance, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory">some
models</a> suggest that investors trade-off between minimizing the
variance of their portfolio and maximizing their average return. Since
humans tend to have a diminishing marginal return to each additional
dollar, investors are risk averse and willing to give up expected
returns for a safer option.</li>

<p><strong>General Properties</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the case that the expected utility for both choices is the
same. Then, this trade-off reduces to: what is the agent’s risk
preference? If risk preference is non-neutral, then this trade-off can
be relevant even when one of the choices has higher expected
utility.</li>
<li>In competitive environments, people often assume an efficient market
and use reverse inference to conclude that if something is more
difficult to attain, then it must be higher quality.</li>

<h3>#6: Some Now vs More Later</h3>
<p>“Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first
four sharpening the axe.” - attributed to Abraham Lincoln</p>
<p>Upside to some now: get some utility right away in current state</p>
<p>Upside to more later: get more utility later</p>
<p><strong>Major Example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In sports, a common choice is made in which an individual player can
either derive some value (e.g., pleasure, status, money) from
<em>playing</em> a game now with one’s current skills, or one can
<em>practice</em> fundamentals now, become better at the sport, and
derive probabilistically more pleasure from playing later.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ancillary Examples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In developmental economics, there is an inverse correlation among
children between hours of work and reading / math skills <a
href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220389908422594"><span
class="citation">(Akabayashi et al., 1999)</span></a>. Children and
their parents derive <em>some</em> utility now from having the children
work but might derive <em>more</em> utility later if they invested more
in education.</li>
<li>In medicine, the health care team must often choose between making a
diagnosis <em>early</em> before the appropriate lab tests have returned,
in order to start treatment sooner, and making a diagnosis
<em>later</em> after the lab results are back, which allows for a
treatment with a higher specificity and thus higher average
utility.</li>

<h3>#7: Flexibility vs Commitment</h3>
<p>“Commitment is healthiest when it’s not without doubt, but in spite
of doubt.” - Rollo May</p>
<p>Upside to flexibility: ability to switch more easily as knowledge or
goals change</p>
<p>Upside to commitment: use resources on optimizing for current
goal</p>
<p><strong>Major Example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In neuroscience, the ability of animals to flexibly alter the
structure of our synaptic networks affords us a powerful ability to
adapt to the reward structure of our environment. But the cost is that
there is a large amount of noise generated from <em>non-adaptive</em>
changes in synaptic structure. One role of sleep may be to help maintain
synaptic homeostasis in the face of this noise while retaining the
“important” memory traces <a
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16376591"><span
class="citation">(Tononi et al., 2006)</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ancillary Examples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In biology, a more <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolvability">evolvable</a> organism,
e.g. one with a lower probability of repairing mismatched DNA base pairs
during replication, will be more able to flexibly generate genetic
diversity and thus switch its phenotype faster over generations via
selection processes. On the other hand, this lower probability of
repairing mismatched DNA will also mean that each generation that
remains in the current environment will be on average less “optimized”
for its current environment.</li>
<li>In literature, a common choice is posed that an individual must
either accept defeat in some capacity or sacrifice his or her values in
order to continue. If you are more willing to sacrifice your ideals, you
gain strategically, but the knowledge of this lack of commitment might
make you less rigorous about working hard, insofar as it makes you more
aware that you are not truly working for something larger than yourself.
Plus, you won’t be achieving your original goals as directly.</li>
<li><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence">Chesterton’s
fence</a> is a thought experiment that asks: if there is a fence in the
middle of a field, and you don’t know what problem it is solving, should
you remove it? By generally requiring one to find out
<em>why</em> fences are in place before removing them, you increase the
costs to flexibility, and thus shift the tendency of one’s actions
towards commitment, which has both upsides and downsides.</li>

<h3>#8: Sensitivity vs Specificity</h3>
<p>“A: My blood test predicts cancer people with cancer 100% of the
time! B: Right, but how often does it predict cancer in people without
cancer?”</p>
<p>Upside to sensitivity: lower false negative detection rate</p>
<p>Upside to specificity: lower false positive detection rate</p>
<p><strong>Major Example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A lifeguard can choose to pay less attention to each individual
momentary dip under water, and thus lower his stress from false alarms
(false positives). But they inevitably do so at the risk of increasing
the risk of an oversight (false negatives) – i.e., not noticing when
someone is underwater for too long. When they pay more attention, they
are employing a more sensitive strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ancillary Examples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanoreceptor">neuroscience</a>,
different types of mechanoreceptors have different sizes of their
receptive fields – the typically oval areas of skin along which a
mechanical stimulus (e.g., touch) leads to a change in that neurons
action potential firing rates. In particular, Pacinian corpuscles have
fairly large receptive fields, making them more sensitive (if you
consider the goal of a mechanoreceptor to sense touch anywhere on the
body), whereas Meissner’s corpuscles have fairly small receptive fields,
making them more specific (if you consider the goal of a mechanoreceptor
to detect movement only in a very small portion of the body).</li>
<li>In <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic">statistics</a>,
a receiver operating characteristic curve allows one to show how the
rates of false positives and false negatives change as you vary the
threshold at which a binary classifier calls examples as either negative
or positive.</li>

<h3>#9: Protection vs Freedom</h3>
<p>“The 2008 FISA amendments sought a compromise between two essential
goals: preserving American liberty and robustly defending Americans’
lives and property.” - Washington Post Editorial Board</p>
<p>Upside to protection: lower average probability of harm from
malevolent choices</p>
<p>Upside to freedom: more choices</p>
<p><strong>Major Example</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>When herds of prey animals are large enough, they stand a chance to
fight off a given predator. Thus they tend to aggregate together,
lowering their freedom but increasing the probability of their survival
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12814600"><span
class="citation">(Khan et al., 2003)</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ancillary Examples</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>In capital-based economic systems, <em>work</em> is one way to trade
freedom <em>now</em> for protection from various uncontrollable forces
in the future.</li>
<li>In politics, economic interventions that increase freedoms, such as
organ donation markets, are typically argued against on the basis of
<em>protecting</em> vulnerable individuals from
<em>exploitation</em>.</li>

<p><strong>Reversal</strong>: This is probably the most abused
trade-off. In general, just because there <em>could</em> be a trade-off
between protection and freedom in a particular context does not mean
that people should just accept that there <em>is</em> one. So do be wary
of people who claim that freedom must be sacrificed for security without
evidence.</p>

<h3>#10: Loyalty vs Universality</h3>
<p>“Duty, Honor, Country. Those three hallowed words reverently dictate
what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be.” - Douglas
MacArthur</p>
<p>Upside to loyalty: relatively more benefits accrue to your closer,
fewer associates</p>
<p>Upside to universality: benefits accrue further, both in geographical
distance and time, and to more total sentient beings</p>
<p><strong>Major Example</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>In <a
href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/">evolutionary
psychology</a>, the theory of kin selection explains how selfish genes
can select for animals that help others, if those others are similar
enough genetically. If the psychological patterns leading to kin
selection are generalized to altruistic tendencies towards others in
general, animals forged by natural selection can shift their mindset
from loyalty to universality.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ancillary Examples</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>In <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice">ethics</a>, one
theory posits that you should consider social justice principles from
behind a “veil of ignorance” that obscures your own particular
situation. This line of thinking is designed to shift people along the
spectrum towards universalism.</li>
<li>In psychology, the amount of money people are willing to pass up in
order to give $75 to someone else decreases as the perceived social
distance increases between them. So, humans tend to only be loyal
towards a fairly limited number of people [<span class="citation">(Jones

<h3>#11: Saving vs Savoring</h3>
<p>“If the world were merely seductive, that would be easy. If it were
merely challenging, that would be no problem. But I arise in the morning
torn between a desire to improve (or save) the world and a desire to
enjoy (or savor) the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.” - <a
href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/E._B._White">E.B. White</a></p>
<p>Upside to saving: improve the world (i.e. better shift your
environment to towards your values)</p>
<p>Upside to savoring: enjoy yourself</p>
<p><strong>Major Example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many Buddhist traditions emphasize letting go from worldly
accomplishments as the path to enlightenment and happiness. But this
seems broadly at odds with working to improve the world.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ancillary Examples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deciding when to retire is often a matter of choosing whether your
marginal contribution through your primary employment over the next few
years is more valuable than your ability to savor time spent in other
ways.</li>
<li>In <a
href="http://healthland.time.com/2011/03/04/why-having-kids-is-foolish/">certain
societies</a>, people who do not have children report higher average
moment-to-moment well-being than those who do not. However, it is often
argued that by having children, parents are contributing more to the
next generation.</li>

</center>
<p><strong>General Properties</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a> and the
idea that <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man&#39;s_Search_for_Meaning">having
a purpose in one’s life leads to increased satisfaction</a> both run
contra to the idea of this as a trade-off. But, these are mostly
interesting insofar as they are exceptions to the general, intuitive
rule that humans make day-to-day trade-offs between enjoying themselves
and getting things done.</li>
<li>This trade-off can be “constructed” by considering the interaction
of Some Now vs More Later and Loyalty vs Universality, where “savoring”
is loyalty to oneself in the short run and “saving” is universality over
the long run. However, this is a common enough interaction that it seems
canon-worthy. </li>
